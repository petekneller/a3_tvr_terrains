This repo contains terrains (images and elevation data) to be used in [Tacview](https://www.tacview.net/product/about/en/) in conjunction with the Arma 3 mod [Tacview Recorder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2754878041).

If you're here it's probably for 1 of 3 reasons:

1. You need to download some terrains so you can view your recorded Arma missions in Tacview. Head on over to the [download page](docs/downloads.md) to grab what you need
2. You want to use an Arma map that isn't currently supported by the mod. [This documentation](docs/adding_content.md) will guide you through setting up a new map in Tacview
3. You've been through 2 to set up a new map for the mod and you want to have it added to this repo. Great! The [contribution docs](docs/contributing.md) will let you know how to get that done.
