This guide should help you get started with recording Arma sessions and replaying them in Tacview. It assumes you've already subscribed to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2754878041]mod[/url] and have come here to figure out what next.

The guide's broken up into 3 sections:
1. Getting started with the mod within Arma
2. Setting up Tacview
3. Viewing recorded sessions and the extra functionality of the Tacview addon

I make a couple of assumptions in this guide: that you've used other mods in Arma before, and that you're familiar with Tacview. If you're entirely new to Tacview then this guide won't cover enough to get you started using the app. Start with the documentation on the website and then have a look at Youtube videos. I'll only be covering in Tacview what's particular to watching Arma recordings.
